iMT, a Plugin for Movable Type
Version 1.11

This plugin will provide a more natural user interface for Apple's iPhone
and iPod touch products.

Drop the files included with this plugin into your Movable Type
directory (under the mt-static/plugins/iMT, plugins/iMT locations).

Once installed, you can access your Movable Type installation from your
iPhone or iPod touch and it should display the new user interface
automatically. No other configuration is required.

This plugin recognizes several mobile devices/browsers, including:

* iPhone (all models)
* iPod touch (all models)
* Opera Mini
* Palm Pre
* Android phones
* Google Nexus One

The plugin does not enable a mobile interface for Apple iPad. If however,
you want to use the iMT interface for iPad, you will need to add this
configuration setting to mt-config.cgi:
